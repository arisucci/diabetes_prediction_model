# diabetes_prediction_model
Experimental classification project for predicting diabetes risk. It utilizes multiple machine learning models: Decision Tree (Scikit-learn), Logistic Regression and SVM (linear and non-linear). Model performance is compared using classification reports and ROC-AUC curves to identify the most effective approach for this problem.
